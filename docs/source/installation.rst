You can then activate your environment by running ``source activate your_environment``.
Now you are all set, and can start using turtleFSI. A detailed explanation for usage of
turtleFSI can be found here_.

If you are using turtleFSI on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster we always
recommend that you build from source, as described below. This is in accordance
with the guidelines provided by the `FEniCS project <https://fenicsproject.org/download/>`_
users to install FEniCS from source when on a HPC cluster.

If you are installing turtleFSI somewhere you do not have root access, typically on a cluster, you can add
``--user`` to install locally.
