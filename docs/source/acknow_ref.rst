Acknowledgements and references
===============================

We would like to acknowledge the open-source project `FEniCS <https://www.fenicsproject.org>`_,
with is the basis of turtleFSI.

The numerical schemes in turtleFSI is presented and tested in Slyngstad [1]_ and Gjertsen [2]_.
The input problem set up for the TF_cfd, TF_csm, and TF_fsi is taken from the Turek et al. [3]_ benchmark
paper.
